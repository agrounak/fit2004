Tutorial Week 3
===================


Problem 5 
- Can apply heapsort or mergesort for the list
- Then maintain i and j 
- if val at i is different from val at j, increase i by 1 and change value at i into the value at j
- writing recurrence relations and writing algorithms

Problem 6
Doesn't put significance into the extra work

Problem 7
- binary search, heap, divide and conquer
- k - size of the max heap
- k log k to insert k items, each taking log k operation
- then continue taking the max -> Reverse the list -> take the minimum values

Problem 8

3,5,7
using min heap for task 4
if no errors occur -> Do not stop the iteration (instead return an empty list)
Change your output for task 3
